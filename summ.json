    "raw-pdf_Efficacy and Safety of the mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine.pdf": "The phase 3 clinical trial for the mRNA-1273 vaccine involved 30,420 participants who were randomly assigned to receive either the vaccine or a placebo. The vaccine demonstrated a high efficacy of 94.1% in preventing symptomatic Covid-19 illness. The trial also showed that the vaccine was effective across different age groups and in participants with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. The vaccine was generally well-tolerated, with mild to moderate side effects such as fatigue and headache being the most common. Severe cases of Covid-19 were significantly lower in the vaccine group compared to the placebo group. Overall, the mRNA-1273 vaccine showed promising results in preventing Covid-19 infection."
